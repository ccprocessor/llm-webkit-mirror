* This test application illustrates a problem which we are experiencing with our Telerik Silverlight GridView.
* The GridView has three columns which display images. The first image column contains a standard Silverlight
* Image Control.  The second column contains a Silverlight User Control which in turn contains a Silverlight
* Image Control.  The third column shows a Silverlight Image Control hosted in a Silverlight Custom Control.
*
* As can be seen from running this application, the first two columns display the correct images when
* scrolling but the third column does not.  As you scroll, the images in the third column come from
* other rows as the Telerik virtualization process reuses some grid components to improve performance.
* If you set the  EnableRowVirtualization property to False, this problem goes away. However, our data
* sets are often very large and setting this property to False results in an unacceptable degradation
* in performance.
*
* The third image column also contains a textblock which displays the Identifier Name.  As can be
* seen, this value is correct even though the wrong image is usually displayed.
*
* We have tried both the User Control and Custom Control approaches in our application and both
* exhibit this scrolling problem.  Of course, our actual controls are much more complex than this
* sample application.
*
* This problem did not occur with the initial release of the Telerik controls from 2010 Q3.
* We first noticed this problem after applying SP1 to the Q3 release.  This test application
* as requested by Telerik support uses the Q1 2011 release.

Finally, while display equations look good for a page of samples, the
    ability to mix math and text in a paragraph is also important.  This
    expression $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$ is an example of an inline equation.  As
    you see, MathJax equations can be used this way as well, without unduly
    disturbing the spacing between lines.

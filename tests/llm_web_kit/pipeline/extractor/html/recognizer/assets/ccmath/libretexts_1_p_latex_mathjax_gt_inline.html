We remember that \(a\cdot b\) means add \(a,\, b\) times. Here, we are using the model just to help us discover the pattern.
What does it mean to multiply \(5\) by \(3\)? It means subtract \(5, 3\) times. Looking at subtraction as taking away, it means to take away \(5, 3\) times. But there is nothing to take away, so we start by adding neutral pairs on the workspace. Then we take away \(5\) three times.
When we multiply a number by \(1\), the result is the same number. What happens when we multiply a number by \(1\)? Lets multiply a positive number and then a negative number by \(1\) to see what we get.
Multiplying a number by \(1\) gives its opposite.

Notice the difference in parts (1) and (2). In part (1), the exponent means to raise what is in the parentheses, the \((2)\) to the \(4^{th}\) power. In part (2), the exponent means to raise just the \(2\) to the \(4^{th}\) power and then take the opposite.

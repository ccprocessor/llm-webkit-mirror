? Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. So, \(15\div 3=5\) because \(5 \cdot 3 = 15\). In words, this expression says that \(15\) can be divided into three groups of five each because adding five three times gives \(15\). Look at some examples of multiplying integers, to figure out the rules for dividing integers.

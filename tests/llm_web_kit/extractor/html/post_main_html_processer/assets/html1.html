                                <p>Music, dance, sculpture, painting—all are said to have their own language, a living
                                    structure that enables each form to express, inspire and engage. The language of
                                    music, for example, in its rhythm, melody, composition not only helps us understand
                                    the power of the art, but guides those who create it. Just as Christopher Alexander
                                    describes good architecture, the best of artistic expressions become as rich and
                                    complex as life itself—indeed they become somehow alive—”like ocean waves or blades
                                    of grass [their] parts are governed by the endless play of repetition and variety
                                    created in the presence of the fact that all things pass.”</p>

                                <p>Perhaps similar principles apply in the social creations of our life, the families,
                                    organizations, communities and businesses in which we “live and breathe and have our
                                    being.” There are organizations, gatherings, companies that are full of life and
                                    those that seem lifeless. We are able to both experience this quality and
                                    participate in releasing it.</p>

                                <p>The purpose of this blog is explore this language of participation as the integrated
                                    application of content, tools and practices in specific contexts, that is, patterns
                                    of engagement that consistently release insight, energy, and creativity. The intent
                                    is to provide a useful guide for individuals, whether or not they show up in formal
                                    leadership roles, to engage in the art of building organizations, communities and
                                    business environments that are enlivening.</p>

                                <p><strong>Markers and Milestones</strong> are stories of discovery that indicate the
                                    presence of a pattern or patterns but not yet clearly defined.</p>

                                <p><strong>Compass Bearings</strong> provide a point of reference for determining the
                                    relative strengths or weaknesses in a given situation as well as guidance for which
                                    kinds of patterns may be most effective.</p>

                                <p><strong>Pattern Abstracts</strong> are preliminary discussions of patterns in
                                    preparation for formally posting them to the Liberating Voices Web site.</p>

                                <p><strong>Patterns in Action</strong> illustrate concrete ways in which typical sets of
                                    patterns tend to arise in similar situations.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: center;"><a
                                        href="http://patterns.gillgrencommunication.com/wp-content/uploads/images/gallery/c-clef-icon.jpg"><img

                                <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Inner Voices</strong>, in the sense of musical
                                    harmony, highlight the role of “mid-range” or “mid-register” voices in adding depth,
                                    richness, texture while reinforcing an overall “centeredness” to the presence and
                                    interplay of patterns in a given situation.</p>

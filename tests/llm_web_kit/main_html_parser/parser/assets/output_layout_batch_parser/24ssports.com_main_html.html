        filesystem. VOV offers a generic database interface in the sense that it traces dependencies
        between named entities residing in persistent databases. </p>

            <p class="p">VOV requires a method to obtain the timestamp of each named entity in the database.
                For example, the most common database is called "FILE", its entities are files, and
                the method to obtain the timestamp of a file is the OS call <code class="ph codeph">stat()</code>. </p>


            <p class="p">VOV supports multiple databases. Some are supported internally. Others must be
                supported externally by special clients called database proxies, which provide the
                server with the needed timestamp for the entities in a database. </p>

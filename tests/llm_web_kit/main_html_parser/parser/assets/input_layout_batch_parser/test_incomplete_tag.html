Hemp is the future of fashion! As one of the strongest and most durable of all natural textile fibres, by wearing hemp we could keep our clothes longer and out of landfill. Hemp is carbon negative, it grows tall and absorbs lots of carbon from the atmosphere.  And it can be grown year after year without harming the soil quality, in fact its deep-reaching roots can instead help to nourish the soil.
Hemp also uses a lot less water to produce compared to cotton, and it doesn’t need all the pesticides to grow. Hemp fabric is breathable, insulating moisture wicking, highly resistant to bacterial growth and microbes and comes with natural UV filtering properties. So why aren’t we using more eco-friendly hemp? In this article we explore what hemp clothing is, what it isn’t and where it could take us. :)

What exactly is hemp clothing? 



Hemp fabric and marijuana are quite different. Upfront before anyone thinks they could recycle their torn hemp socks into a joint. Yes, hemp and what is termed as marijuana or weed stem from the same plant, the cannabis sativa species. 
But one strain has been bred to have a higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content than 0.3, the stuff which gives you the high, mainly found in the flowers, and the other has been bred to get stronger fibres to make for a good fabric. So it would be futile to try and smoke hemp with a low THC. 


Hemp fabric is the legal form of the cannabis plant
Hemp is the legal form of the cannabis plant providing natural, chemical free, environmentally sustainable, durable, yet comfortable, clothing. 
One could say that the fibre sits somewhere between linen and cotton in terms of feel. 


The story of hemp into clothing 

Hemp has been around for a very long time! The versatility of this fibre was discovered in the Middle East (Mesopotamia) as far back as 8,000 BC. An interesting anecdote is that the word canvas stems from the Arabic language describing hemp, or cannabis.

Hemp was also popular in China 

A few thousand years later and the Chinese planted hemp specifically to make clothing, a habit which lives on today. 
Thanks to hemp’s durability the fibre was also used to make paper, ropes, saddle bags, sacks, sails and tents, supporting the ancient economies in their maritime and overland expeditions.

Hemp finally made its way to Europe 

The hemp plant made its way to Europe and the Americas, its seeds added to the food basket, and its oil found its way into medicine and cosmetics.

Hemp remained extremely popular until the 1930s, even car manufactures like Henry Ford played with the plant as an ingredient, thanks to its strength it made for a durable and sustainable plastic. 

The downfall of hemp and cannabis! 

The same popularity on more than one front seems to have rung in its downfall. The synthetic and chemical industrial revolution raised its head, cotton and wood took over the markets requiring chemicals, fertilisers, pesticides, and herbicides, which hemp did not need. And it is said that those making those ingredients wanted to sell them. Luckily for them the popularity of the cannabis plant as a recreational drug was also on the rise, so it was easy to lobby for cannabis cultivation to be outlawed. 
Did the players of industrialisation realise the future damage their chemical-heavy ingredients would have on our environment? Probably not, otherwise they may have rather invested in refining the production of hemp, as is happening in more recent times. Or they may also have simply turned a blind eye to the long term impact due to the short term financial gain they would surely benefit from. 

Hemp in the 21st century 

The cannabis plant has finally found its way back and is in demand. It’s used in cosmetics, as biofuel, found its way into health foods, and into the fashion industry. Today, around 30 countries cultivate what is termed industrial hemp to distinguish it from the ‘marijuana’ cannabis plant. 
China remains the largest producer, followed by France, Austria, Chile,  the UK, Mexico, Germany, Holland, India, Japan and Brazil. 
The US finally lifted their ban on the cannabis (hemp) plant in 2018. 
How is hemp fabric made
Hemp fabric is made from the outer layer of the stems of the Cannabis sativa plant. The stripped fibres are spun into rope, or into finer yarn to make the textile for clothing.  Let’s look at all the steps: 

Hemp loves moist and warmer climates but grows pretty much anywhere and outgrows competition plants. Within 90 days after seeding it gets up to 4.5 metres high ready to be cut and kept lying in the field so it can dry out for a fews days preparing it for the next stage, termed retting.
Retting breaks down the undesired tissues, like pectin which glues the stem fibre (bast) to the woody core of the plant. Moisture and bacteria do the job, either naturally leaving the cut hemp in the field for over a month letting dew and mould do its thing, great for humid climates, or the process can be sped up by taking the harvest and dumping it into water. On a more speedy scale enzymes would be used.
The stalks are allowed to dry and baled for the next step, separating the bast fibre from the core. Thanks to industrialisation this has become an easier process employing large rollers, or decorticators, to crush the stems breaking off the desired fibre. As not all gets loose this way the hemp stalks take another beating, literally.
Scutching takes care of the beating, as well as scraping, to get to the shorter fibres and to comb out any remaining woody pieces. Whilst there are uses for the shorter fibres, leaves and core, it is the long fibre strands we’re after to make clothing fabric. 
The strands are cleaned and yet again bailed. Traditionally they would have been knotted together by hand, but these days machines will get them ready to be steamed and then spun into yarn. Whether machines, or by hand, the process is quite arduous and lengthy, making hemp more expensive than cotton. 


100% hemp clothing 

Clothing made of pure hemp should be in theory organic as no chemicals would have been involved. However, many places in China do use chemicals to process faster. Organic cleaning and softening methods are in development however. In countries like Europe or Canada biologically based enzyme technology makes the process of hemp production more eco-friendly. 

Natural Hemp is beige 

Natural hemp comes in shades of beige and may feel a little rougher than cotton, but it has some staunch advantages.
100% hemp is triple strength! 
It comes in at triple strength making for durable clothing, which doesn’t go out of shape, and is softer with each wash. 
100% hemp keeps natural colours 
Equally, hemp keeps natural dye colours better than cotton, and is easier to lighten. No need for toxic chlorine bleaching, it can be done with an eco-friendly hydrogen peroxide instead.
A point to make note of is that although hemp viscose may be softer, it is not organic.

Hemp blends

Hemp + cotton + Tencel + Silk + Wool + Bamboo 
The reason for hemp blends in general is to achieve enhanced softness yet a more durable piece of clothing. As long as the ingredient number two has been produced organically and sustainably the end-result is nearly as good, if not quite as ecological as a 100% pure hemp garment. 
Challenges faced by brands in switching to hemp 
Due to its turbulent ‘outlaw’ history, cotton production took over as the number one natural fibre in the apparel industry. Hemp cultivation is only just picking up again over the last decade. 
Hemp is in limited supply and expensive 
The issue for brands who want to use hemp is the scarcity of the raw material and with that higher acquisition costs. In some cases it may even be difficult to find a supplier at any cost. The Covid crisis hasn’t helped brands who want to start using hemp, due to reduced manufacturing and transport capabilities across the board. That said, the hemp fibre market is expected to at least triple over by 2028! 

Most hemp production today is industrial 

Whilst China didn’t have the ban issue and produces 70 percent of the world’s hemp crop, most is made for industrial use, and those suitable for clothing may just lack in the wanted areas: sustainability and non-toxic.
There are few certified organic hemp producers 
Conscientious brands would prefer certified organic hemp producers, both, the US and Europe, issue certificates in this regard and global organisations, such as the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certify fabrics, which are at a minimum 70% organic and Ecocert demands a 95% organic guarantee. Again organic labels tend to increase the price.

Hemp needs an image overhaul 
Another point may be hemp’s image, still often linked to the hippie rather than main-stream community. 
Hemp fabric PROS AND CONS

Hemp Fabric Pro #1- Kind to the skin 

Breathable 
Moisture wicking
Anti-bacterial so anti-odour 
Hypoallergenic 
Keeps UV light off the skin (tightly weaved by nature) 


Hemp Fabric Pro #2- Comfortable


Soft enough and gets softer with each wash without degrading 
Thermoregulating aka insulates in winter keeps cool in summer
Lightweight around 40 percent of that of cotton 
Hydrophobic, not waterproof but could repel a drizzle 

Hemp Fabric Pro #3 - Durable 

Doesn’t fade easily keeps colours intact 
Keeps its shape
Resistant to abrasion, piling, bubbling
Its tensile properties let it stretch but not super stretchy
Doesn’t shrink like cotton
Strong at least three times as much as cotton 

Hemp Eco Pro #1- Sustainable cultivation

Hemp’s long roots prevents soil erosion
The Hemp plant takes less land than competing crops 
The hemp plant takes over weed growth 
Hemp restores nutrients to earth rather than depleting meaning same land can be used for decades
Hemp drains soil from poisonous substances and heavy metals 
Hemp is considered carbon negative farming, the plant absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere than it’s production contributes. 
The hemp plant is pest resistant, which means  no need for pesti-and herbicides and its own leaves act as fertiliser 
The hemp plant doesn’t use much water, usually rain is enough
Hemp grows fast, up to ten tons of fibre pulp per acre three times a year 
Hemp fibre yield is 600% higher than flax and double to triple than cotton



Hemp Eco Pro #2- Sustainable production and recycling


Hemp is biodegradable
Hemp is easy to colour with natural dyes 
Environmentally friendly bleaching (thanks to its lo lignin content) 
All parts of the hemp plant can be used for paper, plastic, insulation, animal bedding, fuel
Hemp uses a fraction of the water required to produce cotton

Organic hemp equals employment (by-hand harvest)  


Hemp Fabric Cons 

Hemp is a little rougher than cotton i.e. more texture if left unprocessed
Hemp as a unique natural smell
Hemp wrinkles more easily if organic i.e. untreated 
Strong but constant wrinkling could create weak points in hemp fabric = holes 
Whilst the hemp plant is mould and mildew resistant, the fabric’s fibres in hot and humid climates like other natural fibres are susceptible to mildew and fungi attacks. 


Hemp Eco Cons 


Hemp production requires more nitrogen than cotton et al 


Affordable hemp clothing  

So onto a very important point - is hemp clothing actually affordable? You’re unlikely to find any simple piece of hemp clothing below a $30 price tag. Hemp is a material that’s difficult to source given the current state of supply chains, and pricing reflects that. However, as more brands start to make the switch to sustainability it will become a fabric that’s more and more affordable. 
Hemp-based apparel is more commonly found at a starting price of around $40-60 for tops and t-shirts and the likes. Innerwear can be from $20-40 and hoodies from $80 -150.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp is the future of fashion! <strong>As one of the strongest and most durable of all natural textile fibres, by wearing hemp we could keep our clothes longer and out of landfill.</strong> Hemp is carbon negative, it grows tall and absorbs lots of carbon from the atmosphere.  And it can be grown year after year without harming the soil quality, in fact its deep-reaching roots can instead help to nourish the soil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp also uses a lot less water to produce compared to cotton, and it doesn’t need all the pesticides to grow. Hemp fabric is breathable, insulating moisture wicking, highly resistant to bacterial growth and microbes and comes with natural UV filtering properties. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span><strong>So why aren’t we using more <a href="https://www.fibre2fashion.com/industry-article/5016/hemp-fiber-eco-friendly-fabric">eco-friendly</a> hemp? In this article we explore <a href="https://www.sustainablejungle.com/sustainable-fashion/what-is-hemp-fabric/">what hemp clothing is</a>, what it isn’t and where it could take us. :) </strong></p>

<b>What exactly is hemp clothing?</b> <br><br>
</h2>
<h2 id="table-of-contents-1"></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp fabric and marijuana are quite different. Upfront before anyone thinks they could recycle their torn hemp socks into a joint. Yes, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and what is termed as </span><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hemp-vs-marijuana"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or weed stem from the same plant, the cannabis sativa species. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one strain has been bred to have a higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content than 0.3, the stuff which gives you the high, mainly found in the flowers, and <strong>the other has been bred to get stronger fibres to make for a good fabric. So it would be futile to try and smoke hemp with a low THC. </strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp is the legal form of the cannabis plant providing <strong>natural, chemical free, environmentally <a href="https://innermettle.com/blogs/learn/why-sustainable-activewear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sustainable</a>, durable, yet comfortable, clothing</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One could say that the fibre sits somewhere between linen and cotton in terms of feel. </span></p>

<b>The story of hemp into clothing <br><br></b><a href="http://www.myhempcraft.com/hemp-fiber-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></a>
</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.myhempcraft.com/hemp-fiber-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been around for a very long time! The versatility of this fibre was <strong>discovered in the Middle East (Mesopotamia) as far back as 8,000 BC.</strong> An interesting anecdote is that the word canvas stems from the Arabic language describing hemp, or cannabis.</span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-4">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp was also popular in China</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few thousand years later and the <strong>Chinese planted hemp specifically to make clothing,</strong> a habit which lives on today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to hemp’s durability the fibre was also used to make<strong> paper, ropes, saddle bags, sacks, sails and tents,</strong> supporting the ancient economies in their maritime and overland expeditions.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0318/0779/9355/files/2_28d8a0de-e206-40bf-9fd1-9cb42c1c92a0.jpg?v=1638532716" alt="rope made from hemp"><br></span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-5">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp finally made its way to Europe</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hemp plant made its way to Europe and the Americas, its seeds added to the <strong>food basket</strong>, and its oil found its way into <strong>medicine and cosmetics</strong>.<br></span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span>Hemp remained extremely popular until the 1930s, even car manufactures like Henry Ford played with the plant as an ingredient, </span><strong>thanks to its strength it made for a durable and sustainable plastic. </strong><br><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0318/0779/9355/files/4_40a682a4-4393-415f-b601-bd294b10589f.jpg?v=1638532814" alt=""><br></span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-6">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The downfall of hemp and cannabis!</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same popularity on more than one front seems to have rung in its downfall. <strong>The <a href="https://innermettle.com/blogs/learn/say-no-to-plastic-fibres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">synthetic</a> and chemical industrial revolution raised its head, cotton and wood took over the markets</strong> requiring chemicals, fertilisers, pesticides, and herbicides, which hemp did not need. And it is said that those making those ingredients wanted to sell them. <strong>Luckily for them the popularity of the cannabis plant as a recreational drug was also on the rise, so it was easy to lobby for cannabis cultivation to be outlawed. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did the players of industrialisation realise the future damage their chemical-heavy ingredients would have on our environment? Probably not, otherwise they may have rather invested in refining the production of hemp, as is happening in more recent times. Or they may also have simply turned a blind eye to the long term impact due to the short term financial gain they would surely benefit from. </span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-7">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp in the 21st century</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cannabis plant has finally found its way back and is in demand. <strong>It’s used in cosmetics, as biofuel, found its way into health foods, and into the fashion industry.</strong> Today, around 30 countries cultivate what is termed industrial hemp to distinguish it from the ‘marijuana’ cannabis plant. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0318/0779/9355/files/7.jpg?v=1638532948" alt="hemp plant"><br></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>China remains the largest producer</strong>, followed by France, Austria, Chile,  the UK, Mexico, Germany, Holland, India, Japan and Brazil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US finally lifted their ban on the cannabis (hemp) plant in 2018. </span></p>
<h2 id="table-of-contents-8"><b>How is hemp fabric made<br><br></b></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://hempgazette.com/industrial-hemp/hemp-fiber-production/">Hemp fabric</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> is made from the outer layer of the stems of the Cannabis sativa plant.</strong> The stripped fibres are spun into rope, or into finer yarn to make the textile for clothing.  Let’s look at all the steps: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp loves moist and warmer climates but <strong>grows pretty much anywhere</strong> and<strong> outgrows competition plants</strong>. Within 90 days after seeding it gets up to 4.5 metres high ready to be cut and kept lying in the field so it can dry out for a fews days preparing it for the next stage, termed retting.<br><br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Retting breaks down the undesired tissues</strong>, like pectin which glues the stem fibre (bast) to the woody core of the plant. Moisture and bacteria do the job, either naturally leaving the cut hemp in the field for over a month letting dew and mould do its thing, great for humid climates, or the process can be sped up by taking the harvest and dumping it into water. On a more speedy scale enzymes would be used.<br><br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stalks are allowed to dry and baled for the next step, <strong>separating the bast fibre from the core.</strong> Thanks to industrialisation this has become an easier process employing large rollers, or decorticators, to crush the stems breaking off the desired fibre. As not all gets loose this way the hemp stalks take another beating, literally.<br><br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scutching takes care of the beating, as well as scraping, to get to the shorter fibres and to comb out any remaining woody pieces. Whilst there are uses for the shorter fibres, leaves and core,<strong> it is the long fibre strands we’re after to make clothing fabric. </strong><br><br></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strands are cleaned and yet again bailed. <strong>Traditionally they would have been knotted together by hand, but these days machines will get them ready to be steamed and then spun into yarn.</strong> Whether machines, or by hand, the process is quite arduous and lengthy, making hemp more expensive than cotton. </span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="table-of-contents-9">
<b>100% hemp clothing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <br><br></span>
</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clothing made of pure hemp should be in theory organic as no chemicals would have been involved. However, many places in China do use chemicals to process faster. Organic cleaning and softening methods are in development however. <strong>In countries like Europe or Canada biologically based enzyme technology makes the process of hemp production more eco-friendly. </strong></span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-10">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural Hemp is beige</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural hemp comes in shades of beige and <strong>may feel a little rougher than cotton</strong>, but it has some staunch advantages.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0318/0779/9355/files/11_c26ba92f-63c3-429e-b9dd-4ca0095c649d.jpg?v=1638533115" alt="100% hemp material"><br></span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-11"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% hemp is triple strength! </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes in at triple strength making for <strong>durable clothing</strong>, which doesn’t go out of shape, and is <strong>softer with each wash. </strong></span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-12"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% hemp keeps natural colours </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally, hemp <strong>keeps natural dye colours better</strong> than cotton, and is <strong>easier to lighten.</strong> No need for toxic chlorine bleaching, it can be done with an eco-friendly hydrogen peroxide instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A point to make note of is that although hemp viscose may be softer, it is not organic.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="table-of-contents-13"><strong>Hemp blends</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3 id="table-of-contents-14"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp + cotton + Tencel + Silk + Wool + Bamboo </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for hemp blends in general is <strong>to achieve enhanced softness yet a more durable piece of clothing.</strong> As long as the ingredient number two has been produced organically and sustainably the end-result is nearly as good, if not quite as ecological as a 100% pure hemp garment. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0318/0779/9355/files/18.jpg?v=1638533634" alt="hemp blend fabric"><br></span></p>
<h2 id="table-of-contents-15"><b>Challenges faced by brands in switching to hemp<br> </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to its turbulent ‘outlaw’ history, cotton production took over as the number one natural fibre in the apparel industry. <strong>Hemp cultivation is only just picking up again over the last decade. </strong></span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-16"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp is in limited supply and expensive </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The issue for brands who want to use hemp is the scarcity of the raw material and with that higher acquisition costs.</strong> In some cases it may even be difficult to find a supplier at any cost. The Covid crisis hasn’t helped brands who want to start using hemp, due to reduced manufacturing and transport capabilities across the board. That said, <strong>the </strong></span><strong><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/industrial-hemp-market#">hemp fibre market </a>is expected to at least triple over by 2028! </strong></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-17">
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most hemp production today is industrial</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i>
</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst China didn’t have the ban issue and produces 70 percent of the world’s hemp crop, most is made for industrial use, and those suitable for clothing may just lack in the wanted areas: sustainability and non-toxic.</span></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-18"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are few certified organic hemp producers </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Conscientious brands would prefer certified organic hemp producers</strong>, both, the US and Europe, issue certificates in this regard and global organisations, such as the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certify fabrics, which are at a minimum 70% organic and Ecocert demands a 95% organic guarantee. Again organic labels tend to increase the price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organic certifications: </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2012/03/22/organic-101-what-usda-organic-label-means"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Agriculture<br></span></a><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/organic-farming/organics-glance_en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E.U. Organic Certification Agency<br></span></a><a href="https://www.global-standard.org/the-standard.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Organic Textile Standard</span></a></p>
<h3 id="table-of-contents-19"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp needs an image overhaul </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another point may be hemp’s image, still often linked to the hippie rather than main-stream community. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0318/0779/9355/files/19.jpg?v=1638533708" alt="hemp is often associated with the hippie movement"><br></span></p>

<b>Affordable hemp clothing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  <br><br></span>
</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So onto a very important point - is hemp clothing </span><a href="https://www.panaprium.com/blogs/i/hemp-clothing-expensive"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually affordable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? You’re unlikely to find any simple piece of hemp clothing below a $30 price tag. Hemp is a material that’s difficult to source given the current state of supply chains, and pricing reflects that. However, <strong>as more brands start to make the switch to sustainability it will become a fabric that’s more and more affordable. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hemp-based apparel is more commonly found at a starting price of around $40-60 for tops and t-shirts and the likes. Innerwear can be from $20-40 and hoodies from $80 -150. </span></p>

1. L A circuit is set up consisting of a 120V cell , a 90 ohm resistor and 60 ohm resistor in parallel with a 200 ohm resistor and 300 Ohm resistor 

a motor of 50 ohm resistor is connected across the 300 ohm resistor and is used to pull a 2Kg mass up a slope of inclines 30 degrees to the horizontal...

2. M I was at a large baseball stadium today and they had escalators to bring everyone up to the upper levels at the beginning of the game. At the end of the game, when everyone was leaving, the escalators were shut off and blocked off and everyone was walking down ramps to exit. I was thinking it...

3. C Question
{Consider the system shown to the right. Particles 1 and 2 are fixed in place while particle three is placed at the location shown and released.

Let’s look at the mechanics of q3, which has a mass of 3.00 X 10-5 kg.

What will be the net force on q3?

What will be q3’s acceleration...

4. G Coulombs are the usual unit of charge. Show that ampere-hours are an alternative unit. 
Joules are the normal units for energy. Show that kilowatthours are an alternative.

Don't understand how o do this. Please answer and explain thanks.

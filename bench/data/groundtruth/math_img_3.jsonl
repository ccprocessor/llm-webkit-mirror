fixpoints again.<br />\nI take the fixpoint at 0 for simplicity.<br />\n<br />\nMaybe I havent read the right books, but I feel a large gap in understanding of the subject.<br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand - as usual - I was not able to find the answers anywhere.<br />\n<br />\nAnyway I came to the idea of working with analogue ideas of the hyperbolic fixpoint methods.<br />\n<br />\nFirst I used the limit ideas.<br />\nThis lead to the results here : <br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://math.eretrandre.org/tetrationforum/showthread.php?tid=951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"mycode_url\">http://math.eretrandre.org/tetrationforu...hp?tid=951</a><br />\n<br />\nBut I do not want just limits now , I want equations and series expansions.<br />\n<br />\nThe problem with Taylor is that it has zero radius of convergeance.<br />\n<br />\nI considered the so-called Tommy-Kouznetsov expansions and the tommy equation and so forth.<br />\n<br />\nBut they do not seem to work either.<br />\n<br />\nSo apart from the limit formula's - and their explaination - and some perturbations I know almost nothing for sure.<br />\n<br />\nSince trying to find the \"right equation\" AND the right (associated) converging expansions (as I tried in the thread tommy equation) might be hard because we want 2 things at the same time , I consider to return to Taylor series and just find the \"right equation\".<br />\n<br />\n( It seems easier to find the right equation , then it is to find the right expansion WITHOUT the equation , since the last does not seem to make sense )<br />\n<br />\nSO we return to the Taylor series with nonzero radius.<br />\n<br />\nSO what is THE equation for parabolic fixpoints ?<br />\n<br />\nFor hyperbolic it turned out to be <br />\n<br />\ng( f(x) ) = f(A x)<br />\n<br />\nNotice that near the fixpoint 0 the function g behaves like A x and the iterates behave like A^x.<br />\n<br />\nNotice A^x is the super of A x.<br />\n<br />\nThe analogue should then be<br />\n<br />\ng ( f(x) ) = f( q(A,x) )<br />\n<br />\nNow there are 2 ideas about what q should be based on the above.<br />\n( and those 2 might be both correct and equivalent ! )<br />\n<br />\n1) q(A,x) is the Ath iteration of a nonlinear polynomial truncation of g(x).<br />\nWe then solve the equation by using the Taylor expansion of q(A,x).<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n2) For simplicity assume g grows to 0 at a rate 1/sqrt(x).<br />\n( yes this idea resembles <a href=\"http://math.eretrandre.org/tetrationforum/showthread.php?tid=951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"mycode_url\">http://math.eretrandre.org/tetrationforu...hp?tid=951</a> )<br />\n<br />\nTo compute what t(x) = 1/sqrt(x) is the super of we use the traditional :<br />\n<br />\nt(x) is super of t( t^[-1](x) + 1).<br />\n<br />\nso here 1/sqrt(x) is the super <br />\nof 1/sqrt(1/x^2 + 1)) = x/sqrt(x^2 + 1).<br />\n<br />\nNow let K(x) be the Taylor of x/sqrt(x^2 + 1).<br />\n<br />\nThen we get the equation <br />\n<br />\ng( f(x) ) = f( K(x) )<br />\n<br />\nIn both cases [ 1) and 2) ] it is assumed that g can be solved in terms of a Taylor series with nonzero radius.<br />\n<br />\n( I estimate the radius between 0.5 and 1. )<br />\n<br />\nFrom this we can then compute the analytic superfunctions.<br />\n<br />\nI noticed that this probably has an analogue in terms of linear algebra ;<br />\n<br />\nG( F(x) ) = F ( T(x) )<br />\n<br />\nis isomorphic to G * F = F * T  where G,F,T are carleman matrices.<br />\n<br />\nIm skeptical about what I wrote , so I wonder what you guys think about it.<br />\n<br />\nIf the parabolic indeed works similar to the hyperbolic case I find that an intresting \" meta-math result \" ; by which I mean an intresting fundamental generalization.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nregards<br />\n<br />\ntommy1729<br />\n<br />\n\" Truth is whatever does not go away when we stop believing in it

Then the series convergence is remarkably good, allowing results of arbitrarily high precision without any difficulties.
